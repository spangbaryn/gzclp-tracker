T3 Progression (Accessories)
Start with 3 sets × 15 reps
When you can do 25+ reps on the last AMRAP set, increase weight
Weight increases: 5-10 lbs typically
Focus on quality reps and the pump
Important Notes
AMRAP = As Many Reps As Possible (but leave 1-2 reps in reserve)

Rest Times:

T1: 3-5 minutes between sets
T2: 2-3 minutes between sets
T3: 60-90 seconds between sets
Warm-up: Always warm up properly before working sets. Start with empty bar and gradually increase weight.

Form First: Never sacrifice form for weight. If form breaks down, the rep doesn't count.

Optional T3 Additions
After 2-3 weeks, you can add ONE additional T3 exercise per workout:

Squat days: Abs, leg curls, leg extensions
Bench days: Triceps, chest flies, lateral raises
Deadlift days: Hamstring curls, calf raises, back extensions
OHP days: Biceps, face pulls, rear delts
Start with 1 set and gradually work up to 3 sets over several weeks.
